# Setup JFrog CLI

This GitHub Action downloads, installs and configures JFrog CLI, so that it can be used as part of the workflow.

In addition, the Action includes the following features, when using JFrog CLI to work with Artifactory.
* The connection details of the Artifactory servers used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets. Read more about it [here](#storing-artifactory-servers-details-as-secrets).
* There's no need to add the *build name* and *build number* options and arguments to commands which accpet them.
All build related operations will be automatically recorded with the *Workflow Name* as build name and *Commit Hash* as build number.

# Usage
## General

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v1
- run: jfrog --version
```

## Storing Artifactory servers details as secrets
### General
The connection details of the Artifactory servers used by JFrog CLI can be stored as secrets.

### Creating the configuration on your local machine 
1. Make sure JFrog CLI version **1.29.0** or above is installed on your local machine by running ```jfrog -v```.
2. Configure the details of the Artifactory server by running ```jfrog rt c```.
3. Export the details of the Artifactory server you configured, using the server ID you chose. Do this by running ```jfrog rt c export <SERVER ID>```.
4. Copy the generated token to the clipboard and save it as a secret on GitHub.

### Using the secret in the workflow
To use the saved Artifactory server configuration in the workflow, all you need to do it to expose the secret to the workflow.
The secret should be exposed as an environment variable with the *JF_ARTIFACTORY_* prefix.
Here's how you do this:
```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v1
  env:
    JF_ARTIFACTORY_1: ${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_SECRET_1 }}
- run: |
    # Ping the server
    jfrog rt ping
```
As you can see in the example above, we created a secret named *JF_ARTIFACTORY_SECRET_1* and we exposed it to the workflow 
as the *JF_ARTIFACTORY_1* environment variable. That's it - the ping command will now ping the configured Artifactory server.

If you have multiple Artifactory servers configured as secrets, you can use all of the in the workflow as follows:
```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v1
  env:
    JF_ARTIFACTORY_1: ${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_SECRET_1 }}
    JF_ARTIFACTORY_2: ${{ secrets.JF_ARTIFACTORY_SECRET_2 }}
- run: |
    # Set the Artifactory server to use by providing the server ID (configured by the 'jfrog rt c' command).
    jfrog rt use local-1
    # Ping local-1
    jfrog rt ping
    # Now use the second sever configuration exposed to the Action.
    jfrog rt use local-2
    # Ping local-2
    jfrog rt ping
```
| Important: When exposing more than one Artifactory servers to the Action, you should always add the ```jfrog rt use``` command to specify the server to use. |
| --- |

## Setting the build name and build number when publishing build-info to Artifactory
The Action automatically sets the following environment variables:
*JFROG_CLI_BUILD_NAME* and *JFROG_CLI_BUILD_NUMBER* with the workflow name and commit hash respectively.
You therefore don't need to specify the build name and build number on any of the build related JFrog CLI commands.

In the following example, all downloaded files are registered as depedencies of the build and all uploaded files
are registered as the build artifacts. 
```yml
- run: |
    jfrog rt dl artifacts/
    jfrog rt u aether artifacts/
    jfrog rt bp
```

## Setting JFrog CLI version
By default the JFrog CLI version set in [action.yml](https://github.com/jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli/blob/master/action.yml) is used. To set a specific version, add the *version* input as follows:

```yml
- uses: jfrog/setup-jfrog-cli@v1
  with:
    version: X.Y.Z
```
| Important: Only JFrog CLI versions 1.29.0 or above are supported. |
